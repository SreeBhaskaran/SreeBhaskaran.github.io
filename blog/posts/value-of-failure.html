      Across industries, firms are running more experiments than ever—yet many are less sure what they are learning.
      With consumers becoming more discerning and competitive pressure to find what works, firms increasingly rely on
      pilots, A/B tests, and proof-of-concepts before committing meaningful resources. This is especially true in digital
      products, innovation, and AI—domains where the rules are still emerging and early feedback can be difficult to interpret.
      The logic is straightforward: experiment early, learn cheaply, and avoid costly mistakes later.
      Yet, as a recent <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article observed, many companies that “had fun experimenting” are now under
      pressure to demonstrate real returns from those efforts. As WSJ notes,
      “Business technology leaders are winding down two years of fast-paced artificial intelligence experiments… and putting their
      AI dollars toward proven projects focused on return on investment.” The implicit promise of experimentation—that it reliably
      produces learning—has started to feel less certain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Large investments in AI pilots haven’t resolved the problem. A <em>Forbes</em> article notes that despite billions spent on enterprise AI,
      most organizations struggle to move beyond the pilot stage, and even those that do often find meaningful returns elusive.
      Another industry report reinforces this: unclear objectives, insufficient data readiness, a lack of in-house expertise,
      and misguided pressure to greenlight proofs of concept are sinking many AI initiatives before they reach production.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Many firms aren’t struggling because they lack experimentation—they’re struggling because they lack
      <em>interpretability</em> and <em>scalability</em> of what experiments reveal.

    <h2>Where the Problem Lies: Method and Intent</h2>

    <p>
      So where does the problem lie? It lies in both the <strong>method</strong> and the <strong>intent</strong> behind experimentation.
      Executives increasingly report pilots that generate mixed or contradictory signals, experiments that fail to scale, and early results
      that are difficult to interpret with confidence. In many cases, the challenge is not a lack of data—it is the nature of the information
      experiments generate. Early feedback is often noisy, incomplete, and easy to misread. And without clarity on the purpose of the experiment,
      even good data can lead to ambiguous conclusions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The deployment of AI to automate processes and accelerate testing does not automatically solve these issues. If anything, it can make them worse:
      broad, general-purpose AI models can introduce additional noise into the experimentation process, especially when the underlying measurement systems
      are already imperfect. As <em>Forbes</em> notes, executives often debate whether to adopt the newest model or copy what peers are doing—but that is
      the wrong starting point. AI pilots rarely fail because the model didn’t work; they fail because the foundations are weak:
      fragmented data, unsecured identities, and systems that don’t scale. Scaling isn’t about running more pilots. It’s about moving a smaller number
      of well-governed models into production with confidence.

    <h2>A Simple Lens: What Wordle Teaches About Learning</h2>

    <p>
      So how should firms design their experiments, and what strategy should guide them? One useful lens comes from the popular game <em>Wordle</em>.
      Finding the word through a series of guesses is, in many ways, like running experiments under uncertainty. The strategies that work—and those that fail—
      offer useful pointers for how firms should approach experimentation, especially when the goal is to learn rather than to “win” on the first try.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take, for example, a guess that appears to “work” early in the game—when you start with a word that places one or two letters correctly.
      That small success can feel reassuring, but it is often deceptively comforting because it does not meaningfully narrow the solution space.
      By contrast, a guess that fails completely can be far more informative because it provides a clean slate and forces you toward a different approach.
      When none of the letters fit, the feedback sharply narrows the set of possibilities and clarifies how to proceed next.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="pullquote">
      Experimentation works only when actions are chosen with the intent to learn—not simply to be right on the first try.

    <h2>Why Firms Often Mislearn</h2>

    <p>
      So what does this mean for firms navigating innovation and uncertainty? Many organizations treat experiments as a way to confirm what they already hope is true,
      rather than as a way to learn what they do not yet know. When early results look promising, confidence rises—even when the evidence is fragile.
      When results disappoint, initiatives are quickly abandoned—even when the failure itself is informative. The cost is not just wasted effort, but belief built on weak signals.
    </p>

    <p>
      This bias is reinforced by how experiments are interpreted in practice. Pilots are often judged as “successes” or “failures,” rather than as sources of information.
      Under uncertainty, that framing can be exactly backward: clear failures can teach more than ambiguous successes, especially early in the learning process.
      The challenge is that early experiments rarely produce clean feedback—metrics are imperfect proxies, environments shift, and results reflect a mix of signal and noise.
      Managers can end up drawing confident conclusions from evidence that does little to reduce uncertainty—one reason so many AI pilots generate activity without producing clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>Noisy Experimentation: Why the Strategy Must Change</h2>

    <p>
      This is precisely what we study in our research on noisy experimentation
      (<a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.2024.1133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M&amp;SOM paper</a>).
      The core idea is that experimentation under significant noise requires a fundamentally different approach.
      While AI pilots allow firms to scale experimentation quickly, the signals they produce are often noisy—and, critically,
      the signal-to-noise ratio is not easy to establish in real time. That makes learning more difficult and interpretation more fragile.
    </p>

    <p>
      When noise is high, running faster and more tests is not necessarily the solution. What matters is designing smarter tests that match the uncertainty
      and complexity of the use case. Smart organizations learn when to discount noise and when to act on a signal. In such settings, priors informed by
      human-in-the-loop judgment become even more important.
    </p>

      </svg>
    </div>

    <p>
      There is a second reason experimentation can mislead: experiments don’t happen in a vacuum. As my co-author Sanjiv Erat and his colleagues
      (Ping-Chieh Huang and Zhe Zhang) have shown, experiments can change behavior by shaping incentives
      (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4976827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSRN paper</a>).
      When people know they are being evaluated, they optimize for winning the evaluation, not for producing the best underlying outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      The authors’ model and empirical analysis of data science contests illustrate this dynamic clearly. Many firms run Kaggle-style competitions,
      releasing training data while reserving a private test set to rank submissions. Statistically, an intermediate train–test split seems ideal:
      enough training data to build strong models, and enough test data to reliably rank them. But incentives change the picture. When ranking becomes
      most reliable, contestants have the strongest incentive to submit higher-variance “lottery ticket” models—approaches that are worse on average
      but occasionally score extremely well. An empirical analysis of Kaggle contests over the past five years finds patterns consistent with this behavior.
      The implication is unsettling: firms may accurately pick a winner from a pool of inaccurate submissions.

    <h2>Experimentation in the Age of AI</h2>

    <p>
      The business landscape has accelerated. Consumer needs shift faster. Competitive cycles are shorter. AI has rewritten the rules of product development—through
      wireframes, simulations, and rapid prototyping tools that allow teams to test more ideas than ever before.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the organizations that win won’t be those that simply test more. They will be those that test with intention—designing experiments that generate learning,
      recognizing when noise overwhelms signal, and building foundations strong enough to scale what works. Experimentation is no longer just a tool for discovery.
      In the age of AI, it is a strategic capability—and like Wordle, it rewards those who learn deliberately, not those who merely guess quickly.
    </p>

    <div class="closing-box">
      <strong>Closing thought:</strong> The winners in AI-driven product development won’t just build and test faster. They will experiment smarter—matching
      testing strategies to uncertainty and turning noise into a competitive edge.
